Hello fellow explorer, I am clippy, happy to help.
This challenge is about inode. Do you know what they really are ?
Let me break it down for you :

On each disk (flash drive, HDD, SSD, whatever), there are partitions.
Each partition has one filesystem.
A filesystem is a program made by people (with beards), it's just code.
This code sets the logic of how a file is stored, read, modified, etc.
Since files can be of different sizes, putting them on the disk in chain is not an option
(Remember in ALG, we have the same problem for storing arrays and modifying them later).
So people came up with a solution : file descriptors !
These are chunks of fixed size that tell a bunch of information on a file :
 - The file descriptor's ID
 - When it was created
 - Last modified
 - Who has the rights to do what on it
 - Size
 - Where the file starts on the disk

So, we have a big array of fixed size elements
Each element points to an object (could be a file, a folder, or other things).
Those elements that we called file descriptors, are called inodes in Linux.

To see the contents of the inode of a file, directory or other
Use the stat command : stat [file|folder]
Example : stat ./ => see the inode of the directory you're currently in
There you go ! You have all the tools for level 1
To pass this level, you must find the inode number of a file...
