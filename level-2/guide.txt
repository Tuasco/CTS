Hi again ! You passed level 1. Level 2 is just as easy, but first, knowledge !
Remember them inodes ? Well a single one can point to multiple files.
The effect it has is fascinating : all the files it points to are now linked.
This means that if you modify a file, all the other files get modified as well to have the same content.
This behaviour is similar to a copy, but it's stronger. It's called a hard link.
If you want to know a bit more, read the following section (which is not mandatory btw):

========================
When you copy a file, you create a new inode, that points to a new file.
Then, the content of the first file is written to the second file.

When you move a file, it keeps the same inode, but the file just changes name (and location).

When you hard link a file, a new file is created, but it inherits the same inode as the first file.

Under linux, when you open a file, the OS just has a pointer to the inode of said file.
If two files have the same inode, then opening one has exactly the same effect as opening the other.
This applies to reading, writing, modifying and every other operation on files.
This is why the files are "hard linked".

Small tip: When using the cp (copy), mv (move) or ln (link) command, it always hase the following syntax:
(cp|mv|ln) [source_file] [destination_file]
For example, cp a.txt b.txt copies the content of a.txt (source) into a new file called b.txt (destination)
Similarly, ln a.txt b.txt links to a.txt (source) a new file called b.txt (destination)
========================

To sum up, if you want to duplicate a file, you copy it, which makes them independent after that point.
If you want to create a shortcut to a file like on Windows, a hard link is one possible solution.

To pass this level, you need to replace the content on the second file with the following sentence:
This is the content of file 2
You need to do this without modifying the first file.
