Since inodes are specific to one filesystem (meaning one partition),
You can't create a hardlink that point to a file on another drive.
Symlinks (or symbolic links) overcome this limitation.
Instead of creating anew file and attach it to the inode,
You actually create a new special inode (of type symbolic link)
That contains a link (/dir1/dir2/file.smth) to the file you want.
This very much works like a shortcut and is widely adopted over hardlinks.
Since a new inode is created, you will find a different inode number.

To pass this level, you need to create a couple of symlinks:
There is a script in level-3/usr/local/bin
You need to create a link with the same name in level-3/usr/bin
And another one in level-3/bin

In a regular Linux filesystem, /usr/bin is used to store binaries (programs)
For historical reasons, people want them to also be in /bin
To avoid duplicating them, the whole /bin dir is a symlink to /usr/bin
Sometimes, you want to execute a custom script you make
A good practice is to put it in /usr/local/bin (or /usr/local/share/bin)
To make it available system-wide (not have to type ./[path-to-script])
You can add /usr/local/bin to your PATH variable,
Or you can create a "shortcut" (a symlink) to it in /usr/bin or /bin
