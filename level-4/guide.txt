Hey, you made it to level 4! You've learned about inodes, hard links, and symlinks.
But remember that note from level 3 that said you were imprisoned? It was telling the truth.
You are in what is known as a chroot jail.
This is a mechanism that changes the root directory of a process to a different location in the filesystem.
It's like being locked in a room and thinking it's the whole house. 
his is why you haven't been able to shut down the system; the necessary commands are outside your "jail".
But look, someone left behind a Python script. How convenient!
This script is the key to your escape. It's designed to break out of the chroot environment.

To pass this final level and win the game, you must:
Understand and use the Python script to break out of the chroot jail.
Once you have escaped, execute the command to shut down the computer.
This is the final challenge. Good luck, explorer.
